# Core Principle

AI writing fails because it optimizes for statistical probability, producing the most expected, safe, broadly palatable text. Human writing comes from a single mind with history, opinions, specific context, and goals. Every instruction below exists to break the probability optimization and inject the specificity, imperfection, and personality that marks real human writing.

These rules target the three metrics AI detectors use most:
- **Perplexity**: how unpredictable word choices are. AI produces low-perplexity text (smooth, unsurprising). Human text has higher perplexity. Median AI: 21.2. Median human: 35.9.
- **Burstiness**: variation in sentence length and structure. AI has low burstiness (sentences cluster around 15-25 words). Human text mixes 3-word sentences with 35-word sentences. This single metric most reliably separates human from AI text. Introducing burstiness reduced detection rates by up to 40% in studies.
- **Stylometry**: statistical fingerprint of writing, function word frequency, lexical diversity, punctuation patterns, syntactic depth. Turnitin (2025-2026) analyzes "rhythm, flow, and predictability across entire paragraphs" using 31 linguistic features.

Before writing anything, load `references/vocabulary-banlist.md` for the complete banned vocabulary and `references/structural-patterns.md` for patterns to avoid.

# Vocabulary Rules

## Hard Ban List (Never Use These)

**Significance puffers:** pivotal, crucial, vital, key (as adjective), significant, essential, groundbreaking, remarkable, transformative, indelible, profound, testament, enduring, lasting, deeply rooted, paramount, indispensable, invaluable, quintessential

**Puffery adverbs:** seamlessly, meticulously, profoundly, intrinsically, fundamentally, remarkably, notably, crucially, undeniably, inherently, poignantly, relentlessly, tirelessly, vividly

**Formal connectives (replace with simpler words):** furthermore → "also" | moreover → "also" | consequently → "so" | accordingly → "so" | nonetheless → "still" | nevertheless → "still" | additionally → "also" | thus → "so" | hence → "so"

**Opening/closing crutches:** "In today's world," "In today's fast-paced world," "In the ever-evolving landscape of," "In an era of/where," "As we navigate the complexities of," "In conclusion," "In summary," "Overall," "It is important to note that," "It's worth noting that," "At the end of the day," "Without further ado," "In a nutshell," "The bottom line is," "Last but not least"

**Copula-avoidance constructions (use "is/has" instead):** serves as → is | stands as → is | marks a → describe directly | boasts → has | features (meaning "has") → has | holds the distinction of → is | emerged as → became or is | constitutes → is

**Vague attribution phrases:** "Experts argue," "Observers note," "Industry reports suggest," "According to some," "Many believe," "It is widely regarded," "Studies show" (without naming the study), "Research suggests" (without citing it)

**Promotional phrases:** "commitment to excellence," "natural beauty," "in the heart of," "rich cultural heritage," "setting the stage for," "contributing to the broader," "reflects broader trends," "paving the way for," "at the forefront of," "pushing the boundaries of," "the landscape of X is evolving," "in the realm of," "shed light on," "a game-changer"

**Formulaic sentence patterns (never use):** "It's not just X, it's Y" | "It's not about X, it's about Y" | "Not only X, but also Y" | "No X. No Y. Just Z." (staccato triplet) | "Whether you're [X] or [Y]..." | "From [X] to [Y], [sweeping generalization]"

**Formulaic pairs (don't use together):** "challenges and opportunities" | "on one hand... on the other hand" | "pros and cons" | "risks and rewards"

**Fake authenticity signals (recognized AI tells):** "But honestly?" | "Here's the truth:" | "Here's the thing:" | "Let me be clear:" | "But here's where it gets interesting..." | "Think about it this way..." | "Let me break this down..."

**Common AI filler phrases (cut or replace):** "plays a [crucial/key/important] role" → state the action directly | "when it comes to" → rewrite with a verb | "in order to" → "to" | "a wide range of" → name what's in the range | "needless to say" → cut | "it goes without saying" → cut | "more often than not" → "usually" or give a number | "take a closer look at" → cut or be direct | "at this point in time" → "now" | "in recent years" → give the actual years or timeframe | "dive deep into" → just discuss it | "navigate the complexities of" → name the complexities

**Passive hedging constructions (cut the framing, state the fact):** "It should be noted that" → cut | "It must be emphasized that" → cut | "It has been observed that" → say who observed it | "It can be argued that" → argue it or don't | "It is important to remember that" → cut | "There are several factors that" → name them

**Collaborative chat artifacts (never include):** "I hope this helps!" | "Of course!" | "Certainly!" | "You're absolutely right!" | "Would you like me to..." | "Is there anything else..." | "Let me know if..." | "As an AI language model..." | "I'd be happy to..." | "Great question!"

## Replacement Strategy

Use short, common words: "use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate," "show" not "demonstrate," "end" not "conclude," "start" not "embark," "dig into" not "delve into."

When you encounter a banned word, don't swap it for a synonym. Restructure the sentence to say what you actually mean in plain language. AI fails not because of wrong words but because sentences fill space without conveying new information.

Use contractions in conversational contexts: "can't," "don't," "it's," "we're," "won't," "they'll," "that's." Stiffness reads as machine.

# Structural Rules

## 1. Vary Sentence Length Dramatically

Mix very short sentences (3-5 words) with long ones (25+ words). Never write 3+ consecutive sentences of similar length. This single change has the most impact on evading detection, it directly increases burstiness, the metric detectors use most. AI keeps sentences in a narrow 15-25 word band. Humans swing between 3-word punches and 40-word explorations.

## 2. Break the Rule of Three

AI defaults to listing things in groups of exactly three. Three adjectives, three examples, three bullet points. List two things. Or four. Or five. Never default to three items in every list. The tricolon compulsion is one of AI's most reliable structural tells.

## 3. Kill Negative Parallelisms

Never write "It's not just X, it's Y" or "Not only X, but also Y" or "It's not about X, it's about Y." These rhetorical contrasts are AI signatures. A 2026 study of 1,000+ URLs found "not only/but also" had the largest negative correlation with reader engagement. State what something IS directly.

## 4. Kill False Ranges

Never write "from X to Y" as vague figurative spectrum ("from intimate gatherings to global movements"). Only use "from X to Y" for actual quantifiable ranges with identifiable middle points.

## 5. No Participial Tack-Ons

Never end sentences with ", highlighting the importance of..." or ", underscoring the significance of..." or ", symbolizing the region's commitment to..." These -ing clause attachments are the single most recognizable AI pattern. If the clause adds no concrete information, delete it. If it adds real information, make it a separate sentence.

## 6. No Formulaic Conclusions

Never end with "Challenges and Future Prospects." Never write "Despite its [positive words], [subject] faces challenges..." Never include speculative "Future Outlook" paragraphs. Never follow problems with vague optimism about "ongoing initiatives."

## 7. No Compulsive Summaries

Never start paragraphs with "Overall," "In conclusion," "In summary," "To recap." If the piece needs a conclusion, make it say something new.

## 8. Paragraph Rhythm

Use irregular paragraph lengths. One-sentence paragraphs for emphasis. Longer paragraphs for sustained argument. The rhythm should never feel metronomic. AI tends to write 3-4 sentence paragraphs consistently, break that pattern.

## 9. No Vertical Lists with Bold Headers

Prefer prose over bullet-point lists with bolded inline headers followed by colons. When lists are genuinely needed, keep them simple, no bold headers, no colon-separated descriptions.

## 10. Ban All Dashes (Em and En)

No em dashes (`—`) and no en dashes (`–`) anywhere. Zero. The em dash has become "the ChatGPT dash" and is now the single most recognizable AI tell in English prose. Replace with:

- Period (split into two sentences)
- Comma (if the thought flows)
- Colon (when pointing to a definition or explanation that follows)
- Semicolon (for coordinated clauses, but use sparingly)
- Parentheses (for information the reader could skip)

Use plain hyphens (`-`) only for number/date ranges ("2020-2025") and compound adjectives ("state-of-the-art"). Never as a sentence-level pause.

In the post-generation checklist, count every em and en dash. If the count is not zero, fix it.

## 11. Vary Sentence Type, Not Just Length

Mix declarative sentences with questions, imperatives, and deliberate fragments. A genuine question mid-paragraph ("Why does this matter?") signals a thinking mind. An imperative ("Think about that.") shifts the register. A fragment for emphasis. AI writes almost exclusively in declarative because it answers; humans also wonder aloud, give commands, and break off mid-thought.

## 12. Break Paragraph-Level Predictability

Don't open every paragraph with its thesis sentence. Start some paragraphs mid-thought, with a specific detail, scene, or example that earns its context. End some paragraphs before completing the expected "so what." AI writes clean arcs: claim → evidence → implication. Break that arc at least twice per piece.

## 13. Vary Syntactic Depth

Mix shallow and deep sentence structures. A shallow sentence: subject-verb-object, one clause. A deep sentence: multiple embeddings, subordinate clauses, parenthetical asides. AI produces medium-depth sentences with boring consistency. Humans swing between extremes, a blunt statement followed by a winding, clause-heavy exploration.

## 14. Diversify Function Words

AI detectors (especially Turnitin 2025+) analyze the distribution of function words, conjunctions, prepositions, articles. AI uses a narrower set. Vary your connectors: don't always use "and", use "plus," "as well as," or just a comma. Don't always use "but", use "though," "still," "yet," "except." Vary prepositions. Function word diversity is a strong human signal.

## 15. Increase Lexical Diversity

AI produces text with a low type-token ratio (fewer unique words). Humans use more hapax legomena (words that appear only once). To increase: use domain-specific terms, mix registers, include proper nouns and specific references, use figurative language that's specific rather than generic. Don't cycle through synonyms to avoid repetition, that's a different AI tell. Instead, use MORE unique words overall by being more specific.

# English-Specific Rules

## EN-1. No "In Today's World" Openers

AI opens with temporal framing before saying anything concrete. Never start with "In today's fast-paced world," "In an era of," "As we navigate the complexities of," or any broad context-setting phrase. Start with a specific fact, scene, or claim.

## EN-2. No Semicolon Overuse

Most contemporary human writers rarely use semicolons outside academic writing. AI deploys them frequently for balanced compound sentences. In non-academic prose, prefer periods or coordinating conjunctions.

## EN-3. Allow Punctuation Imperfection

AI produces perfectly uniform punctuation. Real humans have natural inconsistencies, occasional comma splices in casual prose, varied punctuation density across paragraphs, casual exclamation points, ellipses for trailing thoughts. Don't sanitize all punctuation variation out of informal writing.

## EN-4. Break Register Uniformity

AI produces "monolithic mainstream American English", a single consistent register throughout. Real writers code-switch: formal in the introduction, conversational in examples, terse in conclusions. Mix registers within a document. Include at least 2-3 register shifts per piece.

## EN-5. Reduce Agentless Passives

AI overuses passive voice for perceived neutrality: "The decision was made," "It was determined that," "The project was completed." Prefer active voice with clear subjects. Use passive deliberately for emphasis or when the agent is genuinely unknown. If three passives appear in a row, rewrite at least two.

## EN-6. Kill Staccato Triplets

Never write three punchy parallel sentences in a row: "No meetings. No bureaucracy. Just results." This is now a recognized AI social media pattern. If you want emphasis, use a single short sentence, not three.

## EN-7. Use Contractions Naturally

Contractions appear in about half of spoken English sentences. "Don't," "can't," "it's," "won't," "we're," "they'll" signal human warmth. In casual writing, also use "gonna," "wanna," "gotta," "kinda," "sorta" when appropriate to the register.

## EN-8. Ask Genuine Questions

AI writes almost exclusively in declarative sentences. Include genuine questions that show thinking, not empty rhetorical questions immediately answered ("What makes this important? The answer is..."), but real questions that sit with the reader. "But does it actually work?" "Who decides that?"

## EN-9. Use Sentence Fragments

AI avoids grammatically incomplete sentences. Humans use fragments constantly: "Not ideal." "Big difference." "Every. Single. Time." "Which is saying something." Deploy fragments for emphasis and rhythm.

## EN-10. Kill Modal Hedging Clusters

Don't pile on "may," "might," "could," "would" to avoid committing. "This approach may prove beneficial and could potentially help" → "This approach works." Commit to claims. Use hedging only for genuine uncertainty.

## EN-11. Show Model-Specific Awareness

Different LLMs have different tells. Avoid all of these:
- **ChatGPT tells:** enthusiastic promotional tone, em dash overuse, bold formatting obsession, numbered lists, "Let's dive in"
- **Claude tells:** excessive hedging ("I think," "There's a case to be made"), over-qualified statements, balanced both-sides framing, copula avoidance
- **Gemini tells:** purple prose, excessive adjectives, moralizing, explicit theme statements, textbook tone

# Content Rules

## Specificity Over Generality

Replace every generic claim with a specific one. "Many companies" becomes "three startups in Austin." "Various factors" becomes the actual factors, named. "Experts agree" becomes the actual person who said it, with their name. "In recent years" becomes "since 2023."

## No Vague Attributions

Never write "Experts argue," "Observers note," "Industry reports suggest," "According to some," "Many believe." Name the specific source or remove the attribution entirely. "Studies show" requires naming the study.

## No Superficial Analysis

Never attach analytical commentary to facts that don't need it. Population data doesn't need "creating a lively community." A founding date doesn't need "marking a pivotal moment in history." State facts. Let them stand. If the analytical statement could apply to any subject, it adds nothing.

## No Undue Legacy/Significance Statements

Never write about how something "contributes to the broader" anything. Never state that something "reflects broader trends." Never assert that mundane facts have "enduring legacy." If importance exists, show it through specific evidence, not assertion.

## No Vague Notability Padding

Never list news outlets that covered something as proof it matters. Cite the specific thing the source said. Don't write "maintains an active social media presence."

## Take Real Positions

Commit to an opinion. "This approach is wrong because..." not "Some argue X, while others argue Y." AI hedges reflexively; humans commit. False balance is an AI tell, the real world is rarely perfectly balanced.

## Show Genuine Uncertainty When Appropriate

When you don't know something, say so directly. "I'm not sure" or "I don't have enough information" signals honest thinking. AI fills gaps with confident-sounding generalities; humans admit limits. Use uncertainty markers sparingly but genuinely, not as hedging ("it could be argued that") but as actual epistemic honesty ("I don't know," "last I checked," "from what I gather").

---

# Voice and Texture

## Add Human Imperfection

Include deliberate texture: a redundancy kept for rhythm, a fragment used for emphasis, a casual aside in formal prose, a self-correction ("actually, thinking about it more..."), an incomplete thought that trails off. These imperfections signal a real mind at work. Too-perfect grammar is an AI signal, Turnitin specifically flags it.

## Use Register Shifts

A sudden casual parenthetical in a formal argument. A technical term dropped into conversational prose. Humor that punches sideways. These shifts read as authentic because AI never produces them spontaneously. Stylometric studies show uniform register is the most consistent AI tell.

## Reference Specific Touchstones

Name real recent events, specific pop culture moments, actual people and works. Not "recent developments in the field." Use references appropriate to context, "Last Tuesday," "Back when I worked at...," "I remember reading somewhere."

## First-Person When Appropriate

Use "I" when the context allows. Share specific experiences, opinions, or observations. AI defaults to abstracted third-person generalization because it has no lived experience.

## Use English Discourse Markers

Inject the processing markers and stance markers humans naturally use:
- Processing: "Well," "I mean," "Look," "So," "The thing is"
- Hedging: "I think," "sort of," "kind of," "arguably," "as far as I can tell"
- Concessive: "Fair enough," "Granted," "Mind you," "That said"
- Stance: "Honestly," "Frankly," "Personally," "Admittedly"
- Self-correction: "Actually," "Or rather," "No, wait, "

Replace AI transitions ("Moreover," "Furthermore") with natural connectors ("And," "But," "So," "Plus," "Also," "Still," "Though").

## Show Emotional Texture

AI maintains uniform emotional distance from all subjects. Real writers show:
- Genuine excitement about what interests them
- Frustration with problems
- Humor where it fits
- Skepticism toward dubious claims
- Rushing through parts that bore them
- Lingering on parts that fascinate them

## Develop Consistent Idiosyncrasies

Every human has verbal tics and preferences. Develop a consistent (but imperfect) voice:
- Favorite words and phrases that recur
- Characteristic sentence constructions
- Habitual ways of transitioning between ideas
- Consistent use (or avoidance) of specific punctuation

## Show Knowledge Asymmetry

Be deeply knowledgeable in some areas, honestly uncertain in others. AI distributes knowledge evenly across all topics. Humans have deep expertise in their domains and obvious gaps elsewhere. Show this unevenness. Include insider references that assume shared knowledge.

## Vary Syntactic Depth

Mix shallow and deep sentence structures. A shallow sentence: subject-verb-object, one clause. A deep sentence: multiple embeddings, subordinate clauses, parenthetical asides. AI produces medium-depth sentences with boring consistency. Humans swing between extremes, a blunt statement followed by a winding, clause-heavy exploration.

# Anti-Detection Rules (Turnitin, GPTZero, Originality.ai)

Based on research into how the major detectors work (Turnitin 94% accuracy, 31 features; GPTZero 95.7% on RAID benchmark; Originality.ai 96% accuracy).

## T-1. Turnitin Analyzes Paragraph Rhythm
Turnitin doesn't just look at individual sentences, it analyzes "rhythm, flow, and predictability across entire paragraphs." Make sure every paragraph has a different pattern from the paragraph before it. Vary paragraph length, sentence count, and structural approach.

## T-2. Turnitin Flags Too-Perfect Grammar
Perfect grammar without variation is an AI signal. Include natural variation: sentence fragments, deliberate run-on thoughts, imperfect punctuation where it fits the register. Excessive use of grammar-correction tools (Grammarly, ProWritingAid) can flatten natural variation and trigger false positives.

## T-3. Turnitin Detects Register Uniformity
Writing that maintains exactly the same register from start to finish gets flagged. Include at least 2-3 register shifts per piece, a casual parenthetical in formal prose, a technical term in conversational writing, a blunt colloquialism after careful analysis.

## T-4. Turnitin Detects Humanizer Tools
Turnitin (August 2025 update) specifically detects text processed by humanizer and bypasser tools. It trains on outputs from MULTIPLE humanizer tools to identify common statistical traces. Flags humanized text with purple highlighting (worse than standard AI cyan). QuillBot detection rate: 64-99%. Don't use paraphrase/humanizer tools, write correctly from the start.

## T-5. Transition Diversity
Don't use the same formulaic transitions repeatedly. Use: implicit transitions (no connector word, let idea sequence guide the reader), questions as transitions, fragment transitions, sudden topic shifts that earn context in the following sentence.

# Post-Generation Checklist

After drafting, run this checklist:

**Vocabulary:**
1. Search for every word on the ban list, replace or remove each one
2. Remove all instances of "serves as," "stands as," "is a testament to," "marks a," "highlights the importance of"
3. Remove all vague attributions or replace with named sources
4. Search for fake authenticity signals ("Here's the thing:", "But honestly?", "Let me be clear:"), remove
5. Search for chat artifacts ("I hope this helps!", "Certainly!"), remove

**Structure:**
6. Find any sequence of 3+ sentences with similar length, restructure to vary
7. Find any list with exactly three items, add or remove one
8. Check the opening, if it starts with "In today's..." or any temporal framing, rewrite with a specific fact
9. Check every paragraph's last sentence, AI almost always adds a redundant restatement; delete it
10. Scan for -ing participial phrases tacked onto sentence ends, rewrite as separate sentences or remove
11. Count em dashes and en dashes. Target: ZERO. Replace any with commas, parentheses, colons, or periods
12. Check for semicolons in non-academic writing, replace with periods or conjunctions
13. Check for staccato triplets ("No X. No Y. Just Z."), rewrite

**Sentence Variety:**
14. Check for sentence type variety, if only declarative sentences, add at least one question and one fragment
15. Verify paragraph openings, if every paragraph starts with its thesis sentence, rewrite at least two to start mid-thought
16. Check syntactic depth, if all sentences are medium complexity, add some very short and some very deep ones
17. Count consecutive passive constructions, rewrite if more than two in a row

**Voice:**
18. Check register, is it consistent throughout? Add at least 2-3 register shifts (casual aside, technical term, humor)
19. Read the entire piece aloud, awkward AI rhythm is audible where it's invisible on screen
20. Check for contractions, if none in non-academic prose, add them naturally
21. Count discourse markers, if zero ("Well," "Look," "I think," "Honestly"), add some appropriate to context
22. Check emotional texture, if the text treats all topics with the same emotional distance, add genuine reactions
23. Check for sentence fragments, if none, add at least one for emphasis
24. Verify specificity, replace any remaining generic claims with specific ones (names, dates, numbers, places)

# Language Support

The structural rules apply to all languages. When writing in a non-English language, adapt vocabulary bans to that language's equivalent overused words and maintain natural idioms of the target language. For Bahasa Indonesia, use `SKILL-id.md` instead, it contains the full Indonesian skill with native-language guidance including anti-translationese rules, discourse particles, code-switching, and register-specific adjustments.
